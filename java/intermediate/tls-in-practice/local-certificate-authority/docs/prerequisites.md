# Prerequisites

## Required

- Java basics
- The beginner tls-handshake project, or an idea of certificates and chains

## Explicitly not required

- OpenSSL: the authority is plain Java with Bouncy Castle
- A network: the clients validate chains in memory

## What you will need

- A JDK is optional: Gradle finds or downloads JDK 25 by itself. Everything else comes with the Gradle wrapper.
- About an hour for the session guide.

## Tech stack and versions

Pinned in the project's build files, and the latest stable releases when the project was built.

| Technology | Version | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java | 25 | the language and runtime; a Gradle toolchain finds or downloads the JDK |
| Gradle | 9.8.1 (wrapper) | build and run; nothing to install, the wrapper downloads it |
| org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk18on | 1.86 | Bouncy Castle: algorithms and providers the JDK lacks |
| org.bouncycastle:bcpkix-jdk18on | 1.86 | Bouncy Castle PKIX: PEM, X.509 certificates and CMS |
| org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter | 6.1.3, set by junit-bom | JUnit 5: the tests (tests only) |
| org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher | 6.1.3, set by junit-bom | JUnit platform launcher, which Gradle needs to run the tests (tests only) |
| videokit | repository tool (`tools/videokit`) | the narrated video and animation: Piper `en_US-amy-medium`, speed 0.8, longer pauses (the amy-slow voice) |
